1,1,Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
2,1,Genesis,1,2,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
3,1,Genesis,1,3,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
4,1,Genesis,1,4,"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
5,1,Genesis,1,5,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."
6,1,Genesis,1,6,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
7,1,Genesis,1,7,"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so."
8,1,Genesis,1,8,And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
9,1,Genesis,1,9,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
10,1,Genesis,1,10,And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
11,1,Genesis,1,11,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."
12,1,Genesis,1,12,"And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
13,1,Genesis,1,13,And the evening and the morning were the third day.
14,1,Genesis,1,14,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:"
15,1,Genesis,1,15,And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16,1,Genesis,1,16,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."
17,1,Genesis,1,17,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"
18,1,Genesis,1,18,"And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
19,1,Genesis,1,19,And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
20,1,Genesis,1,20,"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
21,1,Genesis,1,21,"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
22,1,Genesis,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
23,1,Genesis,1,23,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
24,1,Genesis,1,24,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
25,1,Genesis,1,25,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
26,1,Genesis,1,26,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
27,1,Genesis,1,27,"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
28,1,Genesis,1,28,"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
29,1,Genesis,1,29,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat."
30,1,Genesis,1,30,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so."
31,1,Genesis,1,31,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
32,1,Genesis,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
33,1,Genesis,2,2,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
34,1,Genesis,2,3,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
35,1,Genesis,2,4,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,"
36,1,Genesis,2,5,"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground."
37,1,Genesis,2,6,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
38,1,Genesis,2,7,"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
39,1,Genesis,2,8,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
40,1,Genesis,2,9,"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
41,1,Genesis,2,10,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."
42,1,Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
43,1,Genesis,2,12,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
44,1,Genesis,2,13,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
45,1,Genesis,2,14,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
46,1,Genesis,2,15,"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
47,1,Genesis,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
48,1,Genesis,2,17,"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
49,1,Genesis,2,18,"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."
50,1,Genesis,2,19,"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof."
51,1,Genesis,2,20,"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him."
52,1,Genesis,2,21,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;"
53,1,Genesis,2,22,"And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."
54,1,Genesis,2,23,"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
55,1,Genesis,2,24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
56,1,Genesis,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
57,1,Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
58,1,Genesis,3,2,"And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
59,1,Genesis,3,3,"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
60,1,Genesis,3,4,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
61,1,Genesis,3,5,"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
62,1,Genesis,3,6,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat."
63,1,Genesis,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
64,1,Genesis,3,8,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
65,1,Genesis,3,9,"And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
66,1,Genesis,3,10,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
67,1,Genesis,3,11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
68,1,Genesis,3,12,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
69,1,Genesis,3,13,"And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."
70,1,Genesis,3,14,"And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
71,1,Genesis,3,15,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
72,1,Genesis,3,16,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
73,1,Genesis,3,17,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
74,1,Genesis,3,18,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
75,1,Genesis,3,19,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
76,1,Genesis,3,20,And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
77,1,Genesis,3,21,"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them."
78,1,Genesis,3,22,"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
79,1,Genesis,3,23,"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."
80,1,Genesis,3,24,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
81,1,Genesis,4,1,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD."
82,1,Genesis,4,2,"And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
83,1,Genesis,4,3,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD."
84,1,Genesis,4,4,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:"
85,1,Genesis,4,5,"But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
86,1,Genesis,4,6,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
87,1,Genesis,4,7,"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."
88,1,Genesis,4,8,"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
89,1,Genesis,4,9,"And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"
90,1,Genesis,4,10,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
91,1,Genesis,4,11,"And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
92,1,Genesis,4,12,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth."
93,1,Genesis,4,13,"And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
94,1,Genesis,4,14,"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me."
95,1,Genesis,4,15,"And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."
96,1,Genesis,4,16,"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
97,1,Genesis,4,17,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."
98,1,Genesis,4,18,And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
99,1,Genesis,4,19,"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
100,1,Genesis,4,20,"And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle."
101,1,Genesis,4,21,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
102,1,Genesis,4,22,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah."
103,1,Genesis,4,23,"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt."
104,1,Genesis,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."
105,1,Genesis,4,25,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."
106,1,Genesis,4,26,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD."
107,1,Genesis,5,1,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;"
108,1,Genesis,5,2,"Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
109,1,Genesis,5,3,"And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:"
110,1,Genesis,5,4,And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
111,1,Genesis,5,5,And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
112,1,Genesis,5,6,"And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:"
113,1,Genesis,5,7,"And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
114,1,Genesis,5,8,And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
115,1,Genesis,5,9,"And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:"
116,1,Genesis,5,10,"And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
117,1,Genesis,5,11,And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
118,1,Genesis,5,12,And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:
119,1,Genesis,5,13,"And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
120,1,Genesis,5,14,And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
121,1,Genesis,5,15,"And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
122,1,Genesis,5,16,"And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
123,1,Genesis,5,17,And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
124,1,Genesis,5,18,"And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:"
125,1,Genesis,5,19,"And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
126,1,Genesis,5,20,And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
127,1,Genesis,5,21,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
128,1,Genesis,5,22,"And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
129,1,Genesis,5,23,And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
130,1,Genesis,5,24,And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
131,1,Genesis,5,25,"And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech."
132,1,Genesis,5,26,"And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:"
133,1,Genesis,5,27,And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
134,1,Genesis,5,28,"And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:"
135,1,Genesis,5,29,"And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed."
136,1,Genesis,5,30,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
137,1,Genesis,5,31,And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
138,1,Genesis,5,32,"And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
139,1,Genesis,6,1,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,"
140,1,Genesis,6,2,That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
141,1,Genesis,6,3,"And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years."
142,1,Genesis,6,4,"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown."
143,1,Genesis,6,5,"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
144,1,Genesis,6,6,"And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
145,1,Genesis,6,7,"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them."
146,1,Genesis,6,8,But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
147,1,Genesis,6,9,"These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God."
148,1,Genesis,6,10,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
149,1,Genesis,6,11,"The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
150,1,Genesis,6,12,"And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth."
151,1,Genesis,6,13,"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
152,1,Genesis,6,14,"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
153,1,Genesis,6,15,"And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
154,1,Genesis,6,16,"A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."
155,1,Genesis,6,17,"And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die."
156,1,Genesis,6,18,"But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
157,1,Genesis,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female."
158,1,Genesis,6,20,"Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."
159,1,Genesis,6,21,"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
160,1,Genesis,6,22,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
161,1,Genesis,7,1,"And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
162,1,Genesis,7,2,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female."
163,1,Genesis,7,3,"Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."
164,1,Genesis,7,4,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth."
165,1,Genesis,7,5,And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
166,1,Genesis,7,6,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
167,1,Genesis,7,7,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
168,1,Genesis,7,8,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,"
169,1,Genesis,7,9,"There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah."
170,1,Genesis,7,10,"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
171,1,Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
172,1,Genesis,7,12,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
173,1,Genesis,7,13,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
174,1,Genesis,7,14,"They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort."
175,1,Genesis,7,15,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life."
176,1,Genesis,7,16,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in."
177,1,Genesis,7,17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth."
178,1,Genesis,7,18,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."
179,1,Genesis,7,19,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered."
180,1,Genesis,7,20,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
181,1,Genesis,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
182,1,Genesis,7,22,"All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died."
183,1,Genesis,7,23,"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark."
184,1,Genesis,7,24,And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
185,1,Genesis,8,1,"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;"
186,1,Genesis,8,2,"The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
187,1,Genesis,8,3,And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
188,1,Genesis,8,4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
189,1,Genesis,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
190,1,Genesis,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
191,1,Genesis,8,7,"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."
192,1,Genesis,8,8,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
193,1,Genesis,8,9,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark."
194,1,Genesis,8,10,And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
195,1,Genesis,8,11,"And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
196,1,Genesis,8,12,And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
197,1,Genesis,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry."
198,1,Genesis,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried."
199,1,Genesis,8,15,"And God spake unto Noah, saying,"
200,1,Genesis,8,16,"Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
201,1,Genesis,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
202,1,Genesis,8,18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:"
203,1,Genesis,8,19,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark."
204,1,Genesis,8,20,"And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
205,1,Genesis,8,21,"And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done."
206,1,Genesis,8,22,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
207,1,Genesis,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
208,1,Genesis,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered."
209,1,Genesis,9,3,Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
210,1,Genesis,9,4,"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."
211,1,Genesis,9,5,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man."
212,1,Genesis,9,6,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
213,1,Genesis,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
214,1,Genesis,9,8,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
215,1,Genesis,9,9,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
216,1,Genesis,9,10,"And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth."
217,1,Genesis,9,11,"And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth."
218,1,Genesis,9,12,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
219,1,Genesis,9,13,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
220,1,Genesis,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
221,1,Genesis,9,15,"And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
222,1,Genesis,9,16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
223,1,Genesis,9,17,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
224,1,Genesis,9,18,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan."
225,1,Genesis,9,19,These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
226,1,Genesis,9,20,"And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:"
227,1,Genesis,9,21,"And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent."
228,1,Genesis,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
229,1,Genesis,9,23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness."
230,1,Genesis,9,24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him."
231,1,Genesis,9,25,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren."
232,1,Genesis,9,26,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
233,1,Genesis,9,27,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
234,1,Genesis,9,28,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
235,1,Genesis,9,29,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
236,1,Genesis,10,1,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood."
237,1,Genesis,10,2,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
238,1,Genesis,10,3,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
239,1,Genesis,10,4,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
240,1,Genesis,10,5,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
241,1,Genesis,10,6,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
242,1,Genesis,10,7,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan."
243,1,Genesis,10,8,And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
244,1,Genesis,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD."
245,1,Genesis,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
246,1,Genesis,10,11,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,"
247,1,Genesis,10,12,And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
248,1,Genesis,10,13,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,"
249,1,Genesis,10,14,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim."
250,1,Genesis,10,15,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,"
251,1,Genesis,10,16,"And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,"
252,1,Genesis,10,17,"And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
253,1,Genesis,10,18,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad."
254,1,Genesis,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha."
255,1,Genesis,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations."
256,1,Genesis,10,21,"Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born."
257,1,Genesis,10,22,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
258,1,Genesis,10,23,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
259,1,Genesis,10,24,And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
260,1,Genesis,10,25,And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
261,1,Genesis,10,26,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
262,1,Genesis,10,27,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
263,1,Genesis,10,28,"And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
264,1,Genesis,10,29,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan."
265,1,Genesis,10,30,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east."
266,1,Genesis,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
267,1,Genesis,10,32,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
268,1,Genesis,11,1,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
269,1,Genesis,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there."
270,1,Genesis,11,3,"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
271,1,Genesis,11,4,"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
272,1,Genesis,11,5,"And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded."
273,1,Genesis,11,6,"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."
274,1,Genesis,11,7,"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
275,1,Genesis,11,8,So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
276,1,Genesis,11,9,Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
277,1,Genesis,11,10,"These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:"
278,1,Genesis,11,11,"And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
279,1,Genesis,11,12,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:"
280,1,Genesis,11,13,"And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
281,1,Genesis,11,14,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
282,1,Genesis,11,15,"And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
283,1,Genesis,11,16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
284,1,Genesis,11,17,"And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
285,1,Genesis,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
286,1,Genesis,11,19,"And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
287,1,Genesis,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:"
288,1,Genesis,11,21,"And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
289,1,Genesis,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
290,1,Genesis,11,23,"And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
291,1,Genesis,11,24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:"
292,1,Genesis,11,25,"And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
293,1,Genesis,11,26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
294,1,Genesis,11,27,"Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot."
295,1,Genesis,11,28,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
296,1,Genesis,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
297,1,Genesis,11,30,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
298,1,Genesis,11,31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there."
299,1,Genesis,11,32,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
300,1,Genesis,12,1,"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee:"
301,1,Genesis,12,2,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
302,1,Genesis,12,3,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
303,1,Genesis,12,4,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran."
304,1,Genesis,12,5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
305,1,Genesis,12,6,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
306,1,Genesis,12,7,"And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him."
307,1,Genesis,12,8,"And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD."
308,1,Genesis,12,9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south."
309,1,Genesis,12,10,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
310,1,Genesis,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:"
311,1,Genesis,12,12,"Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
312,1,Genesis,12,13,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee."
313,1,Genesis,12,14,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
314,1,Genesis,12,15,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
315,1,Genesis,12,16,"And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels."
316,1,Genesis,12,17,And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
317,1,Genesis,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?"
318,1,Genesis,12,19,"Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
319,1,Genesis,12,20,"And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
320,1,Genesis,13,1,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
321,1,Genesis,13,2,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
322,1,Genesis,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;"
323,1,Genesis,13,4,"Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD."
324,1,Genesis,13,5,"And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
325,1,Genesis,13,6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
326,1,Genesis,13,7,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
327,1,Genesis,13,8,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren."
328,1,Genesis,13,9,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
329,1,Genesis,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar."
330,1,Genesis,13,11,Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
331,1,Genesis,13,12,"Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom."
332,1,Genesis,13,13,But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
333,1,Genesis,13,14,"And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:"
334,1,Genesis,13,15,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
335,1,Genesis,13,16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered."
336,1,Genesis,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee."
337,1,Genesis,13,18,"Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD."
338,1,Genesis,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;"
339,1,Genesis,14,2,"That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
340,1,Genesis,14,3,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
341,1,Genesis,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
342,1,Genesis,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
343,1,Genesis,14,6,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness."
344,1,Genesis,14,7,"And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar."
345,1,Genesis,14,8,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;"
346,1,Genesis,14,9,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five."
347,1,Genesis,14,10,"And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain."
348,1,Genesis,14,11,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way."
349,1,Genesis,14,12,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
350,1,Genesis,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram."
351,1,Genesis,14,14,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan."
352,1,Genesis,14,15,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
353,1,Genesis,14,16,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
354,1,Genesis,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale."
355,1,Genesis,14,18,And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
356,1,Genesis,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:"
357,1,Genesis,14,20,"And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all."
358,1,Genesis,14,21,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
359,1,Genesis,14,22,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
360,1,Genesis,14,23,"That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
361,1,Genesis,14,24,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
362,1,Genesis,15,1,"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
363,1,Genesis,15,2,"And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
364,1,Genesis,15,3,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir."
365,1,Genesis,15,4,"And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."
366,1,Genesis,15,5,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
367,1,Genesis,15,6,And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
368,1,Genesis,15,7,"And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
369,1,Genesis,15,8,"And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
370,1,Genesis,15,9,"And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
371,1,Genesis,15,10,"And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not."
372,1,Genesis,15,11,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away."
373,1,Genesis,15,12,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him."
374,1,Genesis,15,13,"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
375,1,Genesis,15,14,"And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
376,1,Genesis,15,15,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
377,1,Genesis,15,16,But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
378,1,Genesis,15,17,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
379,1,Genesis,15,18,"In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:"
380,1,Genesis,15,19,"The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
381,1,Genesis,15,20,"And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,"
382,1,Genesis,15,21,"And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
383,1,Genesis,16,1,"Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
384,1,Genesis,16,2,"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
385,1,Genesis,16,3,"And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife."
386,1,Genesis,16,4,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
387,1,Genesis,16,5,"And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee."
388,1,Genesis,16,6,"But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face."
389,1,Genesis,16,7,"And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
390,1,Genesis,16,8,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."
391,1,Genesis,16,9,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
392,1,Genesis,16,10,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
393,1,Genesis,16,11,"And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction."
394,1,Genesis,16,12,"And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
395,1,Genesis,16,13,"And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
396,1,Genesis,16,14,"Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
397,1,Genesis,16,15,"And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael."
398,1,Genesis,16,16,"And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram."
399,1,Genesis,17,1,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
400,1,Genesis,17,2,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
401,1,Genesis,17,3,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
402,1,Genesis,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations."
403,1,Genesis,17,5,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
404,1,Genesis,17,6,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
405,1,Genesis,17,7,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee."
406,1,Genesis,17,8,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
407,1,Genesis,17,9,"And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations."
408,1,Genesis,17,10,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised."
409,1,Genesis,17,11,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
410,1,Genesis,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed."
411,1,Genesis,17,13,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
412,1,Genesis,17,14,"And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
413,1,Genesis,17,15,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
414,1,Genesis,17,16,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her."
415,1,Genesis,17,17,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"
416,1,Genesis,17,18,"And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
417,1,Genesis,17,19,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him."
418,1,Genesis,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
419,1,Genesis,17,21,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year."
420,1,Genesis,17,22,"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
421,1,Genesis,17,23,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him."
422,1,Genesis,17,24,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
423,1,Genesis,17,25,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
424,1,Genesis,17,26,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
425,1,Genesis,17,27,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
426,1,Genesis,18,1,And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
427,1,Genesis,18,2,"And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,"
428,1,Genesis,18,3,"And said, My LORD, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
429,1,Genesis,18,4,"Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
430,1,Genesis,18,5,"And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
431,1,Genesis,18,6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth."
432,1,Genesis,18,7,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
433,1,Genesis,18,8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
434,1,Genesis,18,9,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
435,1,Genesis,18,10,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him."
436,1,Genesis,18,11,Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
437,1,Genesis,18,12,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
438,1,Genesis,18,13,"And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?"
439,1,Genesis,18,14,"Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son."
440,1,Genesis,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
441,1,Genesis,18,16,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
442,1,Genesis,18,17,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;"
443,1,Genesis,18,18,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
444,1,Genesis,18,19,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
445,1,Genesis,18,20,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
446,1,Genesis,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
447,1,Genesis,18,22,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD."
448,1,Genesis,18,23,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
449,1,Genesis,18,24,Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
450,1,Genesis,18,25,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
451,1,Genesis,18,26,"And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
452,1,Genesis,18,27,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:"
453,1,Genesis,18,28,"Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it."
454,1,Genesis,18,29,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake."
455,1,Genesis,18,30,"And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
456,1,Genesis,18,31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake."
457,1,Genesis,18,32,"And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake."
458,1,Genesis,18,33,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."
459,1,Genesis,19,1,And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
460,1,Genesis,19,2,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
461,1,Genesis,19,3,"And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat."
462,1,Genesis,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
463,1,Genesis,19,5,"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them."
464,1,Genesis,19,6,"And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,"
465,1,Genesis,19,7,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
466,1,Genesis,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
467,1,Genesis,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door."
468,1,Genesis,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
469,1,Genesis,19,11,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
470,1,Genesis,19,12,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:"
471,1,Genesis,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it."
472,1,Genesis,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law."
473,1,Genesis,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
474,1,Genesis,19,16,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
475,1,Genesis,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
476,1,Genesis,19,18,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:"
477,1,Genesis,19,19,"Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:"
478,1,Genesis,19,20,"Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live."
479,1,Genesis,19,21,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken."
480,1,Genesis,19,22,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
481,1,Genesis,19,23,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
482,1,Genesis,19,24,Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
483,1,Genesis,19,25,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
484,1,Genesis,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
485,1,Genesis,19,27,And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
486,1,Genesis,19,28,"And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
487,1,Genesis,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
488,1,Genesis,19,30,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
489,1,Genesis,19,31,"And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:"
490,1,Genesis,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
491,1,Genesis,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
492,1,Genesis,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
493,1,Genesis,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
494,1,Genesis,19,36,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
495,1,Genesis,19,37,"And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day."
496,1,Genesis,19,38,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day."
497,1,Genesis,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
498,1,Genesis,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
499,1,Genesis,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife."
500,1,Genesis,20,4,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
501,1,Genesis,20,5,"Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this."
502,1,Genesis,20,6,"And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her."
503,1,Genesis,20,7,"Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine."
504,1,Genesis,20,8,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid."
505,1,Genesis,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
506,1,Genesis,20,10,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
507,1,Genesis,20,11,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake."
508,1,Genesis,20,12,"And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
509,1,Genesis,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
510,1,Genesis,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
511,1,Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee."
512,1,Genesis,20,16,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved."
513,1,Genesis,20,17,"So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children."
514,1,Genesis,20,18,"For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife."
515,1,Genesis,21,1,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken."
516,1,Genesis,21,2,"For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
517,1,Genesis,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac."
518,1,Genesis,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
519,1,Genesis,21,5,"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him."
520,1,Genesis,21,6,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me."
521,1,Genesis,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age."
522,1,Genesis,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned."
523,1,Genesis,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking."
524,1,Genesis,21,10,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
525,1,Genesis,21,11,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
526,1,Genesis,21,12,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
527,1,Genesis,21,13,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
528,1,Genesis,21,14,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
529,1,Genesis,21,15,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
530,1,Genesis,21,16,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept."
531,1,Genesis,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is."
532,1,Genesis,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation."
533,1,Genesis,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
534,1,Genesis,21,20,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
535,1,Genesis,21,21,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
536,1,Genesis,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:"
537,1,Genesis,21,23,"Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
538,1,Genesis,21,24,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
539,1,Genesis,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
540,1,Genesis,21,26,"And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day."
541,1,Genesis,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant."
542,1,Genesis,21,28,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
543,1,Genesis,21,29,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?"
544,1,Genesis,21,30,"And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well."
545,1,Genesis,21,31,Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
546,1,Genesis,21,32,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
547,1,Genesis,21,33,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God."
548,1,Genesis,21,34,And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
549,1,Genesis,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am."
550,1,Genesis,22,2,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
551,1,Genesis,22,3,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him."
552,1,Genesis,22,4,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
553,1,Genesis,22,5,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
554,1,Genesis,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together."
555,1,Genesis,22,7,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
556,1,Genesis,22,8,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."
557,1,Genesis,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
558,1,Genesis,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
559,1,Genesis,22,11,"And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I."
560,1,Genesis,22,12,"And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me."
561,1,Genesis,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son."
562,1,Genesis,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen."
563,1,Genesis,22,15,"And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,"
564,1,Genesis,22,16,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:"
565,1,Genesis,22,17,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
566,1,Genesis,22,18,And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
567,1,Genesis,22,19,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba."
568,1,Genesis,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;"
569,1,Genesis,22,21,"Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
570,1,Genesis,22,22,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
571,1,Genesis,22,23,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
572,1,Genesis,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah."
573,1,Genesis,23,1,And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
574,1,Genesis,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
575,1,Genesis,23,3,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,"
576,1,Genesis,23,4,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
577,1,Genesis,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
578,1,Genesis,23,6,"Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
579,1,Genesis,23,7,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth."
580,1,Genesis,23,8,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
581,1,Genesis,23,9,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you."
582,1,Genesis,23,10,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
583,1,Genesis,23,11,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead."
584,1,Genesis,23,12,And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
585,1,Genesis,23,13,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
586,1,Genesis,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
587,1,Genesis,23,15,"My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
588,1,Genesis,23,16,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant."
589,1,Genesis,23,17,"And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure"
590,1,Genesis,23,18,"Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city."
591,1,Genesis,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan."
592,1,Genesis,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth."
593,1,Genesis,24,1,"And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things."
594,1,Genesis,24,2,"And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:"
595,1,Genesis,24,3,"And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:"
596,1,Genesis,24,4,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac."
597,1,Genesis,24,5,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?"
598,1,Genesis,24,6,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again."
599,1,Genesis,24,7,"The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence."
600,1,Genesis,24,8,"And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again."
601,1,Genesis,24,9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter."
602,1,Genesis,24,10,"And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor."
603,1,Genesis,24,11,"And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water."
604,1,Genesis,24,12,"And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham."
605,1,Genesis,24,13,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:"
606,1,Genesis,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master."
607,1,Genesis,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
608,1,Genesis,24,16,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
609,1,Genesis,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher."
610,1,Genesis,24,18,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
611,1,Genesis,24,19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking."
612,1,Genesis,24,20,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
613,1,Genesis,24,21,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not."
614,1,Genesis,24,22,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;"
615,1,Genesis,24,23,"And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
616,1,Genesis,24,24,"And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor."
617,1,Genesis,24,25,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
618,1,Genesis,24,26,"And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD."
619,1,Genesis,24,27,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren."
620,1,Genesis,24,28,"And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things."
621,1,Genesis,24,29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well."
622,1,Genesis,24,30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well."
623,1,Genesis,24,31,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
624,1,Genesis,24,32,"And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him."
625,1,Genesis,24,33,"And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on."
626,1,Genesis,24,34,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
627,1,Genesis,24,35,"And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses."
628,1,Genesis,24,36,And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
629,1,Genesis,24,37,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:"
630,1,Genesis,24,38,"But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son."
631,1,Genesis,24,39,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me."
632,1,Genesis,24,40,"And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:"
633,1,Genesis,24,41,"Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath."
634,1,Genesis,24,42,"And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:"
635,1,Genesis,24,43,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;"
636,1,Genesis,24,44,"And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son."
637,1,Genesis,24,45,"And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
638,1,Genesis,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
639,1,Genesis,24,47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands."
640,1,Genesis,24,48,"And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son."
641,1,Genesis,24,49,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
642,1,Genesis,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good."
643,1,Genesis,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken."
644,1,Genesis,24,52,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
645,1,Genesis,24,53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
646,1,Genesis,24,54,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master."
647,1,Genesis,24,55,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go."
648,1,Genesis,24,56,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master."
649,1,Genesis,24,57,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
650,1,Genesis,24,58,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
651,1,Genesis,24,59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
652,1,Genesis,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them."
653,1,Genesis,24,61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
654,1,Genesis,24,62,And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
655,1,Genesis,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming."
656,1,Genesis,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel."
657,1,Genesis,24,65,"For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself."
658,1,Genesis,24,66,And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
659,1,Genesis,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
660,1,Genesis,25,1,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah."
661,1,Genesis,25,2,"And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
662,1,Genesis,25,3,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
663,1,Genesis,25,4,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
664,1,Genesis,25,5,And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
665,1,Genesis,25,6,"But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
666,1,Genesis,25,7,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years."
667,1,Genesis,25,8,"Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people."
668,1,Genesis,25,9,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;"
669,1,Genesis,25,10,"The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
670,1,Genesis,25,11,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi."
671,1,Genesis,25,12,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:"
672,1,Genesis,25,13,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
673,1,Genesis,25,14,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
674,1,Genesis,25,15,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
675,1,Genesis,25,16,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations."
676,1,Genesis,25,17,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people."
677,1,Genesis,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren."
678,1,Genesis,25,19,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:"
679,1,Genesis,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
680,1,Genesis,25,21,"And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
681,1,Genesis,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD."
682,1,Genesis,25,23,"And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger."
683,1,Genesis,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
684,1,Genesis,25,25,"And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."
685,1,Genesis,25,26,"And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them."
686,1,Genesis,25,27,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents."
687,1,Genesis,25,28,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob."
688,1,Genesis,25,29,"And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:"
689,1,Genesis,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom."
690,1,Genesis,25,31,"And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright."
691,1,Genesis,25,32,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"
692,1,Genesis,25,33,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob."
693,1,Genesis,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright."
694,1,Genesis,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar."
695,1,Genesis,26,2,"And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:"
696,1,Genesis,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;"
697,1,Genesis,26,4,"And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;"
698,1,Genesis,26,5,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
699,1,Genesis,26,6,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
700,1,Genesis,26,7,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon."
701,1,Genesis,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife."
702,1,Genesis,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her."
703,1,Genesis,26,10,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us."
704,1,Genesis,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
705,1,Genesis,26,12,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him."
706,1,Genesis,26,13,"And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:"
707,1,Genesis,26,14,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him."
708,1,Genesis,26,15,"For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
709,1,Genesis,26,16,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we."
710,1,Genesis,26,17,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
711,1,Genesis,26,18,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
712,1,Genesis,26,19,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
713,1,Genesis,26,20,"And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
714,1,Genesis,26,21,"And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
715,1,Genesis,26,22,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
716,1,Genesis,26,23,And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
717,1,Genesis,26,24,"And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
718,1,Genesis,26,25,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well."
719,1,Genesis,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army."
720,1,Genesis,26,27,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
721,1,Genesis,26,28,"And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;"
722,1,Genesis,26,29,"That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD."
723,1,Genesis,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink."
724,1,Genesis,26,31,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
725,1,Genesis,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water."
726,1,Genesis,26,33,And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.
727,1,Genesis,26,34,"And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
728,1,Genesis,26,35,Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
729,1,Genesis,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I."
730,1,Genesis,27,2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
731,1,Genesis,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;"
732,1,Genesis,27,4,"And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die."
733,1,Genesis,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
734,1,Genesis,27,6,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
735,1,Genesis,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death."
736,1,Genesis,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee."
737,1,Genesis,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:"
738,1,Genesis,27,10,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death."
739,1,Genesis,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:"
740,1,Genesis,27,12,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
741,1,Genesis,27,13,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them."
742,1,Genesis,27,14,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved."
743,1,Genesis,27,15,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:"
744,1,Genesis,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:"
745,1,Genesis,27,17,"And she gave the savory meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
746,1,Genesis,27,18,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?"
747,1,Genesis,27,19,"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
748,1,Genesis,27,20,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me."
749,1,Genesis,27,21,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not."
750,1,Genesis,27,22,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
751,1,Genesis,27,23,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him."
752,1,Genesis,27,24,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
753,1,Genesis,27,25,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank."
754,1,Genesis,27,26,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
755,1,Genesis,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:"
756,1,Genesis,27,28,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:"
757,1,Genesis,27,29,"Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee."
758,1,Genesis,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
759,1,Genesis,27,31,"And he also had made savory meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me."
760,1,Genesis,27,32,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau."
761,1,Genesis,27,33,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed."
762,1,Genesis,27,34,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
763,1,Genesis,27,35,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing."
764,1,Genesis,27,36,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
765,1,Genesis,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?"
766,1,Genesis,27,38,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
767,1,Genesis,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
768,1,Genesis,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
769,1,Genesis,27,41,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
770,1,Genesis,27,42,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee."
771,1,Genesis,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;"
772,1,Genesis,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;"
773,1,Genesis,27,45,"Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
774,1,Genesis,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
775,1,Genesis,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
776,1,Genesis,28,2,"Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother."
777,1,Genesis,28,3,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;"
778,1,Genesis,28,4,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham."
779,1,Genesis,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
780,1,Genesis,28,6,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
781,1,Genesis,28,7,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;"
782,1,Genesis,28,8,And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
783,1,Genesis,28,9,"Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife."
784,1,Genesis,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran."
785,1,Genesis,28,11,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
786,1,Genesis,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
787,1,Genesis,28,13,"And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;"
788,1,Genesis,28,14,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
789,1,Genesis,28,15,"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."
790,1,Genesis,28,16,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not."
791,1,Genesis,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
792,1,Genesis,28,18,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."
793,1,Genesis,28,19,And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
794,1,Genesis,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
795,1,Genesis,28,21,So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
796,1,Genesis,28,22,"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
797,1,Genesis,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
798,1,Genesis,29,2,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth."
799,1,Genesis,29,3,"And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place."
800,1,Genesis,29,4,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we."
801,1,Genesis,29,5,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him."
802,1,Genesis,29,6,"And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
803,1,Genesis,29,7,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
804,1,Genesis,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep."
805,1,Genesis,29,9,"And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them."
806,1,Genesis,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
807,1,Genesis,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
808,1,Genesis,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father."
809,1,Genesis,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
810,1,Genesis,29,14,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month."
811,1,Genesis,29,15,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
812,1,Genesis,29,16,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
813,1,Genesis,29,17,Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.
814,1,Genesis,29,18,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
815,1,Genesis,29,19,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
816,1,Genesis,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
817,1,Genesis,29,21,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her."
818,1,Genesis,29,22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
819,1,Genesis,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her."
820,1,Genesis,29,24,And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
821,1,Genesis,29,25,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"
822,1,Genesis,29,26,"And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
823,1,Genesis,29,27,"Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
824,1,Genesis,29,28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also."
825,1,Genesis,29,29,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
826,1,Genesis,29,30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
827,1,Genesis,29,31,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren."
828,1,Genesis,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."
829,1,Genesis,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon."
830,1,Genesis,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
831,1,Genesis,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing."
832,1,Genesis,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
833,1,Genesis,30,2,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
834,1,Genesis,30,3,"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
835,1,Genesis,30,4,And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
836,1,Genesis,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son."
837,1,Genesis,30,6,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan."
838,1,Genesis,30,7,"And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son."
839,1,Genesis,30,8,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
840,1,Genesis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife."
841,1,Genesis,30,10,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
842,1,Genesis,30,11,"And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
843,1,Genesis,30,12,And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
844,1,Genesis,30,13,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
845,1,Genesis,30,14,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
846,1,Genesis,30,15,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes."
847,1,Genesis,30,16,"And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
848,1,Genesis,30,17,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son."
849,1,Genesis,30,18,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
850,1,Genesis,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son."
851,1,Genesis,30,20,"And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
852,1,Genesis,30,21,"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
853,1,Genesis,30,22,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
854,1,Genesis,30,23,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
855,1,Genesis,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son."
856,1,Genesis,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country."
857,1,Genesis,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee."
858,1,Genesis,30,27,"And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake."
859,1,Genesis,30,28,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it."
860,1,Genesis,30,29,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me."
861,1,Genesis,30,30,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?"
862,1,Genesis,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock."
863,1,Genesis,30,32,"I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire."
864,1,Genesis,30,33,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me."
865,1,Genesis,30,34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
866,1,Genesis,30,35,"And he removed that day the he goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons."
867,1,Genesis,30,36,And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
868,1,Genesis,30,37,"And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
869,1,Genesis,30,38,"And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
870,1,Genesis,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted."
871,1,Genesis,30,40,"And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle."
872,1,Genesis,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
873,1,Genesis,30,42,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
874,1,Genesis,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses."
875,1,Genesis,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory."
876,1,Genesis,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before."
877,1,Genesis,31,3,"And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
878,1,Genesis,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,"
879,1,Genesis,31,5,"And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me."
880,1,Genesis,31,6,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
881,1,Genesis,31,7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."
882,1,Genesis,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ring-streaked."
883,1,Genesis,31,9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
884,1,Genesis,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled."
885,1,Genesis,31,11,"And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I."
886,1,Genesis,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee."
887,1,Genesis,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred."
888,1,Genesis,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
889,1,Genesis,31,15,"Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money."
890,1,Genesis,31,16,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do."
891,1,Genesis,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
892,1,Genesis,31,18,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan."
893,1,Genesis,31,19,And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
894,1,Genesis,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
895,1,Genesis,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead."
896,1,Genesis,31,22,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
897,1,Genesis,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
898,1,Genesis,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
899,1,Genesis,31,25,Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
900,1,Genesis,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
901,1,Genesis,31,27,"Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
902,1,Genesis,31,28,And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
903,1,Genesis,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
904,1,Genesis,31,30,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
905,1,Genesis,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me."
906,1,Genesis,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
907,1,Genesis,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
908,1,Genesis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not."
909,1,Genesis,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images."
910,1,Genesis,31,36,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
911,1,Genesis,31,37,"Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both."
912,1,Genesis,31,38,"This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten."
913,1,Genesis,31,39,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night."
914,1,Genesis,31,40,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes."
915,1,Genesis,31,41,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
916,1,Genesis,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
917,1,Genesis,31,43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?"
918,1,Genesis,31,44,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
919,1,Genesis,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
920,1,Genesis,31,46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap."
921,1,Genesis,31,47,And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
922,1,Genesis,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;"
923,1,Genesis,31,49,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
924,1,Genesis,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee."
925,1,Genesis,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:"
926,1,Genesis,31,52,"This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm."
927,1,Genesis,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac."
928,1,Genesis,31,54,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
929,1,Genesis,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place."
930,1,Genesis,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
931,1,Genesis,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
932,1,Genesis,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
933,1,Genesis,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:"
934,1,Genesis,32,5,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
935,1,Genesis,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
936,1,Genesis,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;"
937,1,Genesis,32,8,"And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape."
938,1,Genesis,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:"
939,1,Genesis,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands."
940,1,Genesis,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children."
941,1,Genesis,32,12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
942,1,Genesis,32,13,And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
943,1,Genesis,32,14,"Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,"
944,1,Genesis,32,15,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals."
945,1,Genesis,32,16,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
946,1,Genesis,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
947,1,Genesis,32,18,"Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us."
948,1,Genesis,32,19,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him."
949,1,Genesis,32,20,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me."
950,1,Genesis,32,21,So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
951,1,Genesis,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
952,1,Genesis,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had."
953,1,Genesis,32,24,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
954,1,Genesis,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
955,1,Genesis,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
956,1,Genesis,32,27,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
957,1,Genesis,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
958,1,Genesis,32,29,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there."
959,1,Genesis,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
960,1,Genesis,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh."
961,1,Genesis,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank."
962,1,Genesis,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids."
963,1,Genesis,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
964,1,Genesis,33,3,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
965,1,Genesis,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
966,1,Genesis,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant."
967,1,Genesis,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
968,1,Genesis,33,7,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
969,1,Genesis,33,8,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord."
970,1,Genesis,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself."
971,1,Genesis,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."
972,1,Genesis,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it."
973,1,Genesis,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
974,1,Genesis,33,13,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die."
975,1,Genesis,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir."
976,1,Genesis,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord."
977,1,Genesis,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
978,1,Genesis,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
979,1,Genesis,33,18,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city."
980,1,Genesis,33,19,"And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money."
981,1,Genesis,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael."
982,1,Genesis,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
983,1,Genesis,34,2,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
984,1,Genesis,34,3,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel."
985,1,Genesis,34,4,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife."
986,1,Genesis,34,5,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
987,1,Genesis,34,6,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
988,1,Genesis,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done."
989,1,Genesis,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife."
990,1,Genesis,34,9,"And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
991,1,Genesis,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
992,1,Genesis,34,11,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give."
993,1,Genesis,34,12,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife."
994,1,Genesis,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:"
995,1,Genesis,34,14,"And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:"
996,1,Genesis,34,15,"But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;"
997,1,Genesis,34,16,"Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
998,1,Genesis,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
999,1,Genesis,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
1000,1,Genesis,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
1001,1,Genesis,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
1002,1,Genesis,34,21,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
1003,1,Genesis,34,22,"Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
1004,1,Genesis,34,23,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us."
1005,1,Genesis,34,24,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
1006,1,Genesis,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
1007,1,Genesis,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out."
1008,1,Genesis,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister."
1009,1,Genesis,34,28,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,"
1010,1,Genesis,34,29,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house."
1011,1,Genesis,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
1012,1,Genesis,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
1013,1,Genesis,35,1,"And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
1014,1,Genesis,35,2,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:"
1015,1,Genesis,35,3,"And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
1016,1,Genesis,35,4,"And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
1017,1,Genesis,35,5,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
1018,1,Genesis,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him."
1019,1,Genesis,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
1020,1,Genesis,35,8,"But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth."
1021,1,Genesis,35,9,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him."
1022,1,Genesis,35,10,"And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel."
1023,1,Genesis,35,11,"And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;"
1024,1,Genesis,35,12,"And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
1025,1,Genesis,35,13,And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
1026,1,Genesis,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."
1027,1,Genesis,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel."
1028,1,Genesis,35,16,"And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
1029,1,Genesis,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
1030,1,Genesis,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."
1031,1,Genesis,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."
1032,1,Genesis,35,20,And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
1033,1,Genesis,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."
1034,1,Genesis,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
1035,1,Genesis,35,23,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
1036,1,Genesis,35,24,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
1037,1,Genesis,35,25,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
1038,1,Genesis,35,26,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram."
1039,1,Genesis,35,27,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
1040,1,Genesis,35,28,And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
1041,1,Genesis,35,29,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
1042,1,Genesis,36,1,"Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom."
1043,1,Genesis,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
1044,1,Genesis,36,3,"And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
1045,1,Genesis,36,4,And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;
1046,1,Genesis,36,5,"And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan."
1047,1,Genesis,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
1048,1,Genesis,36,7,For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
1049,1,Genesis,36,8,Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
1050,1,Genesis,36,9,And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
1051,1,Genesis,36,10,"These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau."
1052,1,Genesis,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
1053,1,Genesis,36,12,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
1054,1,Genesis,36,13,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
1055,1,Genesis,36,14,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah."
1056,1,Genesis,36,15,"These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,"
1057,1,Genesis,36,16,"Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah."
1058,1,Genesis,36,17,"And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
1059,1,Genesis,36,18,"And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife."
1060,1,Genesis,36,19,"These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes."
1061,1,Genesis,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,"
1062,1,Genesis,36,21,"And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
1063,1,Genesis,36,22,And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
1064,1,Genesis,36,23,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
1065,1,Genesis,36,24,"And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
1066,1,Genesis,36,25,"And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah."
1067,1,Genesis,36,26,"And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran."
1068,1,Genesis,36,27,"The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan."
1069,1,Genesis,36,28,"The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran."
1070,1,Genesis,36,29,"These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,"
1071,1,Genesis,36,30,"Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir."
1072,1,Genesis,36,31,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
1073,1,Genesis,36,32,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
1074,1,Genesis,36,33,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
1075,1,Genesis,36,34,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead."
1076,1,Genesis,36,35,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
1077,1,Genesis,36,36,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
1078,1,Genesis,36,37,"And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead."
1079,1,Genesis,36,38,"And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
1080,1,Genesis,36,39,"And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
1081,1,Genesis,36,40,"And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,"
1082,1,Genesis,36,41,"Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,"
1083,1,Genesis,36,42,"Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,"
1084,1,Genesis,36,43,"Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites."
1085,1,Genesis,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
1086,1,Genesis,37,2,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report."
1087,1,Genesis,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors."
1088,1,Genesis,37,4,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."
1089,1,Genesis,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
1090,1,Genesis,37,6,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
1091,1,Genesis,37,7,"For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf."
1092,1,Genesis,37,8,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
1093,1,Genesis,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."
1094,1,Genesis,37,10,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
1095,1,Genesis,37,11,And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
1096,1,Genesis,37,12,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
1097,1,Genesis,37,13,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I."
1098,1,Genesis,37,14,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
1099,1,Genesis,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
1100,1,Genesis,37,16,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks."
1101,1,Genesis,37,17,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan."
1102,1,Genesis,37,18,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him."
1103,1,Genesis,37,19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh."
1104,1,Genesis,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
1105,1,Genesis,37,21,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him."
1106,1,Genesis,37,22,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again."
1107,1,Genesis,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;"
1108,1,Genesis,37,24,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
1109,1,Genesis,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt."
1110,1,Genesis,37,26,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?"
1111,1,Genesis,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content."
1112,1,Genesis,37,28,"Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt."
1113,1,Genesis,37,29,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes."
1114,1,Genesis,37,30,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?"
1115,1,Genesis,37,31,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
1116,1,Genesis,37,32,"And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no."
1117,1,Genesis,37,33,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."
1118,1,Genesis,37,34,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
1119,1,Genesis,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him."
1120,1,Genesis,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard."
1121,1,Genesis,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
1122,1,Genesis,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her."
1123,1,Genesis,38,3,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er."
1124,1,Genesis,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan."
1125,1,Genesis,38,5,"And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him."
1126,1,Genesis,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar."
1127,1,Genesis,38,7,"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him."
1128,1,Genesis,38,8,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
1129,1,Genesis,38,9,"And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother."
1130,1,Genesis,38,10,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
1131,1,Genesis,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
1132,1,Genesis,38,12,"And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
1133,1,Genesis,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep."
1134,1,Genesis,38,14,"And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife."
1135,1,Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face."
1136,1,Genesis,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
1137,1,Genesis,38,17,"And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?"
1138,1,Genesis,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
1139,1,Genesis,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
1140,1,Genesis,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
1141,1,Genesis,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place."
1142,1,Genesis,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place."
1143,1,Genesis,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
1144,1,Genesis,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
1145,1,Genesis,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff."
1146,1,Genesis,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
1147,1,Genesis,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb."
1148,1,Genesis,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
1149,1,Genesis,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez."
1150,1,Genesis,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah."
1151,1,Genesis,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither."
1152,1,Genesis,39,2,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
1153,1,Genesis,39,3,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
1154,1,Genesis,39,4,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
1155,1,Genesis,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field."
1156,1,Genesis,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored."
1157,1,Genesis,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
1158,1,Genesis,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;"
1159,1,Genesis,39,9,"There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
1160,1,Genesis,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
1161,1,Genesis,39,11,"And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
1162,1,Genesis,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
1163,1,Genesis,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
1164,1,Genesis,39,14,"That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
1165,1,Genesis,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out."
1166,1,Genesis,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home."
1167,1,Genesis,39,17,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
1168,1,Genesis,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out."
1169,1,Genesis,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
1170,1,Genesis,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
1171,1,Genesis,39,21,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
1172,1,Genesis,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it."
1173,1,Genesis,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper."
1174,1,Genesis,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt."
1175,1,Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
1176,1,Genesis,40,3,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
1177,1,Genesis,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward."
1178,1,Genesis,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison."
1179,1,Genesis,40,6,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad."
1180,1,Genesis,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?"
1181,1,Genesis,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you."
1182,1,Genesis,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
1183,1,Genesis,40,10,"And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
1184,1,Genesis,40,11,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
1185,1,Genesis,40,12,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:"
1186,1,Genesis,40,13,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
1187,1,Genesis,40,14,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
1188,1,Genesis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
1189,1,Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:"
1190,1,Genesis,40,17,And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
1191,1,Genesis,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:"
1192,1,Genesis,40,19,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
1193,1,Genesis,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
1194,1,Genesis,40,21,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
1195,1,Genesis,40,22,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
1196,1,Genesis,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him."
1197,1,Genesis,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
1198,1,Genesis,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow."
1199,1,Genesis,41,3,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favored and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river."
1200,1,Genesis,41,4,And the ill favored and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
1201,1,Genesis,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
1202,1,Genesis,41,6,"And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them."
1203,1,Genesis,41,7,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream."
1204,1,Genesis,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
1205,1,Genesis,41,9,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
1206,1,Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:"
1207,1,Genesis,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
1208,1,Genesis,41,12,"And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
1209,1,Genesis,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged."
1210,1,Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh."
1211,1,Genesis,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it."
1212,1,Genesis,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
1213,1,Genesis,41,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
1214,1,Genesis,41,18,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:"
1215,1,Genesis,41,19,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favored and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
1216,1,Genesis,41,20,And the lean and the ill favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
1217,1,Genesis,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
1218,1,Genesis,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:"
1219,1,Genesis,41,23,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
1220,1,Genesis,41,24,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
1221,1,Genesis,41,25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do."
1222,1,Genesis,41,26,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
1223,1,Genesis,41,27,And the seven thin and ill favored kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
1224,1,Genesis,41,28,This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he showeth unto Pharaoh.
1225,1,Genesis,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
1226,1,Genesis,41,30,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
1227,1,Genesis,41,31,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
1228,1,Genesis,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
1229,1,Genesis,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
1230,1,Genesis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
1231,1,Genesis,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
1232,1,Genesis,41,36,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
1233,1,Genesis,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
1234,1,Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?"
1235,1,Genesis,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:"
1236,1,Genesis,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
1237,1,Genesis,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
1238,1,Genesis,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
1239,1,Genesis,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
1240,1,Genesis,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
1241,1,Genesis,41,45,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
1242,1,Genesis,41,46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
1243,1,Genesis,41,47,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
1244,1,Genesis,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same."
1245,1,Genesis,41,49,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number."
1246,1,Genesis,41,50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him."
1247,1,Genesis,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
1248,1,Genesis,41,52,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
1249,1,Genesis,41,53,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
1250,1,Genesis,41,54,"And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
1251,1,Genesis,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
1252,1,Genesis,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt."
1253,1,Genesis,41,57,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
1254,1,Genesis,42,1,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
1255,1,Genesis,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
1256,1,Genesis,42,3,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
1257,1,Genesis,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him."
1258,1,Genesis,42,5,And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
1259,1,Genesis,42,6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth."
1260,1,Genesis,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1261,1,Genesis,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
1262,1,Genesis,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1263,1,Genesis,42,10,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come."
1264,1,Genesis,42,11,"We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies."
1265,1,Genesis,42,12,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1266,1,Genesis,42,13,"And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
1267,1,Genesis,42,14,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:"
1268,1,Genesis,42,15,"Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither."
1269,1,Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies."
1270,1,Genesis,42,17,And he put them all together into ward three days.
1271,1,Genesis,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:"
1272,1,Genesis,42,19,"If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:"
1273,1,Genesis,42,20,"But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
1274,1,Genesis,42,21,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
1275,1,Genesis,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required."
1276,1,Genesis,42,23,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
1277,1,Genesis,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
1278,1,Genesis,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them."
1279,1,Genesis,42,26,"And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence."
1280,1,Genesis,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth."
1281,1,Genesis,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
1282,1,Genesis,42,29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,"
1283,1,Genesis,42,30,"The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
1284,1,Genesis,42,31,"And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:"
1285,1,Genesis,42,32,"We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
1286,1,Genesis,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
1287,1,Genesis,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land."
1288,1,Genesis,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
1289,1,Genesis,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
1290,1,Genesis,42,37,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
1291,1,Genesis,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1292,1,Genesis,43,1,And the famine was sore in the land.
1293,1,Genesis,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
1294,1,Genesis,43,3,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1295,1,Genesis,43,4,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
1296,1,Genesis,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1297,1,Genesis,43,6,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
1298,1,Genesis,43,7,"And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
1299,1,Genesis,43,8,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
1300,1,Genesis,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
1301,1,Genesis,43,10,"For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time."
1302,1,Genesis,43,11,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
1303,1,Genesis,43,12,"And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:"
1304,1,Genesis,43,13,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
1305,1,Genesis,43,14,"And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
1306,1,Genesis,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
1307,1,Genesis,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon."
1308,1,Genesis,43,17,And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
1309,1,Genesis,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses."
1310,1,Genesis,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,"
1311,1,Genesis,43,20,"And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
1312,1,Genesis,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
1313,1,Genesis,43,22,And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
1314,1,Genesis,43,23,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
1315,1,Genesis,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender."
1316,1,Genesis,43,25,And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
1317,1,Genesis,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
1318,1,Genesis,43,27,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?"
1319,1,Genesis,43,28,"And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance."
1320,1,Genesis,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son."
1321,1,Genesis,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
1322,1,Genesis,43,31,"And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
1323,1,Genesis,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1324,1,Genesis,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another."
1325,1,Genesis,43,34,"And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
1326,1,Genesis,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
1327,1,Genesis,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
1328,1,Genesis,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses."
1329,1,Genesis,44,4,"And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?"
1330,1,Genesis,44,5,"Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
1331,1,Genesis,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words."
1332,1,Genesis,44,7,"And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:"
1333,1,Genesis,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"
1334,1,Genesis,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen."
1335,1,Genesis,44,10,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless."
1336,1,Genesis,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
1337,1,Genesis,44,12,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
1338,1,Genesis,44,13,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
1339,1,Genesis,44,14,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
1340,1,Genesis,44,15,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
1341,1,Genesis,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
1342,1,Genesis,44,17,"And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."
1343,1,Genesis,44,18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh."
1344,1,Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
1345,1,Genesis,44,20,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him."
1346,1,Genesis,44,21,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
1347,1,Genesis,44,22,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
1348,1,Genesis,44,23,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
1349,1,Genesis,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
1350,1,Genesis,44,25,"And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food."
1351,1,Genesis,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us."
1352,1,Genesis,44,27,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:"
1353,1,Genesis,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:"
1354,1,Genesis,44,29,"And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1355,1,Genesis,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"
1356,1,Genesis,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
1357,1,Genesis,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever."
1358,1,Genesis,44,33,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren."
1359,1,Genesis,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father."
1360,1,Genesis,45,1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren."
1361,1,Genesis,45,2,And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
1362,1,Genesis,45,3,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
1363,1,Genesis,45,4,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
1364,1,Genesis,45,5,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life."
1365,1,Genesis,45,6,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest."
1366,1,Genesis,45,7,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
1367,1,Genesis,45,8,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
1368,1,Genesis,45,9,"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:"
1369,1,Genesis,45,10,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
1370,1,Genesis,45,11,"And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty."
1371,1,Genesis,45,12,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you."
1372,1,Genesis,45,13,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither."
1373,1,Genesis,45,14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
1374,1,Genesis,45,15,"Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
1375,1,Genesis,45,16,"And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
1376,1,Genesis,45,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;"
1377,1,Genesis,45,18,"And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
1378,1,Genesis,45,19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
1379,1,Genesis,45,20,Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
1380,1,Genesis,45,21,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
1381,1,Genesis,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment."
1382,1,Genesis,45,23,"And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way."
1383,1,Genesis,45,24,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way."
1384,1,Genesis,45,25,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,"
1385,1,Genesis,45,26,"And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not."
1386,1,Genesis,45,27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
1387,1,Genesis,45,28,"And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
1388,1,Genesis,46,1,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."
1389,1,Genesis,46,2,"And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I."
1390,1,Genesis,46,3,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:"
1391,1,Genesis,46,4,I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
1392,1,Genesis,46,5,"And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
1393,1,Genesis,46,6,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
1394,1,Genesis,46,7,"His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
1395,1,Genesis,46,8,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn."

1399,1,Genesis,46,12,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul."
1400,1,Genesis,46,13,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."
1401,1,Genesis,46,14,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
1402,1,Genesis,46,15,"These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three."

1413,1,Genesis,46,26,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;"
1414,1,Genesis,46,27,"And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten."
1415,1,Genesis,46,28,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
1416,1,Genesis,46,29,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
1417,1,Genesis,46,30,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive."
1418,1,Genesis,46,31,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;"
1419,1,Genesis,46,32,"And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
1420,1,Genesis,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
1421,1,Genesis,46,34,"That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1422,1,Genesis,47,1,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
1423,1,Genesis,47,2,"And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh."
1424,1,Genesis,47,3,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers."
1425,1,Genesis,47,4,"They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
1426,1,Genesis,47,5,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:"
1427,1,Genesis,47,6,"The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
1428,1,Genesis,47,7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
1429,1,Genesis,47,8,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?"
1430,1,Genesis,47,9,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
1431,1,Genesis,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
1432,1,Genesis,47,11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
1433,1,Genesis,47,12,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families."
1434,1,Genesis,47,13,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine."
1435,1,Genesis,47,14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
1436,1,Genesis,47,15,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth."
1437,1,Genesis,47,16,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail."
1438,1,Genesis,47,17,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year."
1439,1,Genesis,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
1440,1,Genesis,47,19,"Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate."
1441,1,Genesis,47,20,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's."
1442,1,Genesis,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof."
1443,1,Genesis,47,22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands."
1444,1,Genesis,47,23,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land."
1445,1,Genesis,47,24,"And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
1446,1,Genesis,47,25,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
1447,1,Genesis,47,26,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's."
1448,1,Genesis,47,27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
1449,1,Genesis,47,28,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
1450,1,Genesis,47,29,"And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:"
1451,1,Genesis,47,30,"But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
1452,1,Genesis,47,31,"And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head."
1453,1,Genesis,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
1454,1,Genesis,48,2,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
1455,1,Genesis,48,3,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
1456,1,Genesis,48,4,"And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession."
1457,1,Genesis,48,5,"And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
1458,1,Genesis,48,6,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance."
1459,1,Genesis,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem."
1460,1,Genesis,48,8,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
1461,1,Genesis,48,9,"And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them."
1462,1,Genesis,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
1463,1,Genesis,48,11,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath showed me also thy seed."
1464,1,Genesis,48,12,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
1465,1,Genesis,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him."
1466,1,Genesis,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn."
1467,1,Genesis,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,"
1468,1,Genesis,48,16,"The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1469,1,Genesis,48,17,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head."
1470,1,Genesis,48,18,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head."
1471,1,Genesis,48,19,"And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations."
1472,1,Genesis,48,20,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
1473,1,Genesis,48,21,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
1474,1,Genesis,48,22,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
1475,1,Genesis,49,1,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days."
1476,1,Genesis,49,2,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father."
1477,1,Genesis,49,3,"Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:"
1478,1,Genesis,49,4,"Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch."
1479,1,Genesis,49,5,Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
1480,1,Genesis,49,6,"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall."

1497,1,Genesis,49,23,"The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:"
1498,1,Genesis,49,24,"But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)"
1499,1,Genesis,49,25,"Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:"
1500,1,Genesis,49,26,"The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
1501,1,Genesis,49,27,"Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil."
1502,1,Genesis,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
1503,1,Genesis,49,29,"And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
1504,1,Genesis,49,30,"In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace."
1505,1,Genesis,49,31,There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
1506,1,Genesis,49,32,The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
1507,1,Genesis,49,33,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people."
1508,1,Genesis,50,1,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
1509,1,Genesis,50,2,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
1510,1,Genesis,50,3,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
1511,1,Genesis,50,4,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
1512,1,Genesis,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
1513,1,Genesis,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
1514,1,Genesis,50,7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
1515,1,Genesis,50,8,"And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
1516,1,Genesis,50,9,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
1517,1,Genesis,50,10,"And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
1518,1,Genesis,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan."
1519,1,Genesis,50,12,And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
1520,1,Genesis,50,13,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
1521,1,Genesis,50,14,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
1522,1,Genesis,50,15,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
1523,1,Genesis,50,16,"And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,"
1524,1,Genesis,50,17,"So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him."
1525,1,Genesis,50,18,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants."
1526,1,Genesis,50,19,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?"
1527,1,Genesis,50,20,"But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."
1528,1,Genesis,50,21,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them."
1529,1,Genesis,50,22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years."
1530,1,Genesis,50,23,And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
1531,1,Genesis,50,24,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
1532,1,Genesis,50,25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
1533,1,Genesis,50,26,"So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
7214,9,1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:"
7215,9,1 Samuel,1,2,"And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
7216,9,1 Samuel,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there."
7217,9,1 Samuel,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
7218,9,1 Samuel,1,5,But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.
7219,9,1 Samuel,1,6,"And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb."
7220,9,1 Samuel,1,7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat."
7221,9,1 Samuel,1,8,"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?"
7222,9,1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD."
7223,9,1 Samuel,1,10,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore."
7224,9,1 Samuel,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
7225,9,1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth."
7226,9,1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken."
7227,9,1 Samuel,1,14,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee."
7228,9,1 Samuel,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD."
7229,9,1 Samuel,1,16,Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
7230,9,1 Samuel,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him."
7231,9,1 Samuel,1,18,"And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad."
7232,9,1 Samuel,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her."
7233,9,1 Samuel,1,20,"Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD."
7234,9,1 Samuel,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."
7235,9,1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever."
7236,9,1 Samuel,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him."
7237,9,1 Samuel,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young."
7238,9,1 Samuel,1,25,"And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli."
7239,9,1 Samuel,1,26,"And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD."
7240,9,1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
7241,9,1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.
7242,9,1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation."
7243,9,1 Samuel,2,2,There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
7244,9,1 Samuel,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed."
7245,9,1 Samuel,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength."
7246,9,1 Samuel,2,5,They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
7247,9,1 Samuel,2,6,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up."
7248,9,1 Samuel,2,7,"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up."
7249,9,1 Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them."
7250,9,1 Samuel,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail."
7251,9,1 Samuel,2,10,"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
7252,9,1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
7253,9,1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
7254,9,1 Samuel,2,13,"And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;"
7255,9,1 Samuel,2,14,"And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither."
7256,9,1 Samuel,2,15,"Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw."
7257,9,1 Samuel,2,16,"And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force."
7258,9,1 Samuel,2,17,Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
7259,9,1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod."
7260,9,1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
7261,9,1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home."
7262,9,1 Samuel,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
7263,9,1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
7264,9,1 Samuel,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people."
7265,9,1 Samuel,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress."
7266,9,1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them."
7267,9,1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men."
7268,9,1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?"
7269,9,1 Samuel,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?"
7270,9,1 Samuel,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?"
7271,9,1 Samuel,2,30,"Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed."
7272,9,1 Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house."
7273,9,1 Samuel,2,32,"And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever."
7274,9,1 Samuel,2,33,"And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age."
7275,9,1 Samuel,2,34,"And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them."
7276,9,1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever."
7277,9,1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."
7278,9,1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
7279,9,1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;"
7280,9,1 Samuel,3,3,"And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;"
7281,9,1 Samuel,3,4,"That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I."
7282,9,1 Samuel,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
7283,9,1 Samuel,3,6,"And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again."
7284,9,1 Samuel,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him."
7285,9,1 Samuel,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child."
7286,9,1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
7287,9,1 Samuel,3,10,"And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth."
7288,9,1 Samuel,3,11,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle."
7289,9,1 Samuel,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end."
7290,9,1 Samuel,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not."
7291,9,1 Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever."
7292,9,1 Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision."
7293,9,1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I."
7294,9,1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee."
7295,9,1 Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good."
7296,9,1 Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
7297,9,1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.
7298,9,1 Samuel,3,21,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
7299,9,1 Samuel,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek."
7300,9,1 Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men."
7301,9,1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies."
7302,9,1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
7303,9,1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again."
7304,9,1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp."
7305,9,1 Samuel,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore."
7306,9,1 Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
7307,9,1 Samuel,4,9,"Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight."
7308,9,1 Samuel,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen."
7309,9,1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
7310,9,1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head."
7311,9,1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out."
7312,9,1 Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli."
7313,9,1 Samuel,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see."
7314,9,1 Samuel,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?"
7315,9,1 Samuel,4,17,"And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken."
7316,9,1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
7317,9,1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her."
7318,9,1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it."
7319,9,1 Samuel,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband."
7320,9,1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken."
7321,9,1 Samuel,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod."
7322,9,1 Samuel,5,2,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
7323,9,1 Samuel,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again."
7324,9,1 Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him."
7325,9,1 Samuel,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day."
7326,9,1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof."
7327,9,1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god."
7328,9,1 Samuel,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither."
7329,9,1 Samuel,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts."
7330,9,1 Samuel,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people."
7331,9,1 Samuel,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
7332,9,1 Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
7333,9,1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
7334,9,1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place."
7335,9,1 Samuel,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
7336,9,1 Samuel,6,4,"Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords."
7337,9,1 Samuel,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
7338,9,1 Samuel,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
7339,9,1 Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:"
7340,9,1 Samuel,6,8,"And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go."
7341,9,1 Samuel,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us."
7342,9,1 Samuel,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:"
7343,9,1 Samuel,6,11,"And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods."
7344,9,1 Samuel,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh."
7345,9,1 Samuel,6,13,"And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it."
7346,9,1 Samuel,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD."
7347,9,1 Samuel,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD."
7348,9,1 Samuel,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
7349,9,1 Samuel,6,17,"And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;"
7350,9,1 Samuel,6,18,"And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite."
7351,9,1 Samuel,6,19,"And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter."
7352,9,1 Samuel,6,20,"And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?"
7353,9,1 Samuel,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you."
7354,9,1 Samuel,7,1,"And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD."
7355,9,1 Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD."
7356,9,1 Samuel,7,3,"And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
7357,9,1 Samuel,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only."
7358,9,1 Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD."
7359,9,1 Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh."
7360,9,1 Samuel,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines."
7361,9,1 Samuel,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."
7362,9,1 Samuel,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him."
7363,9,1 Samuel,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel."
7364,9,1 Samuel,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar."
7365,9,1 Samuel,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us."
7366,9,1 Samuel,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
7367,9,1 Samuel,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
7368,9,1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
7369,9,1 Samuel,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places."
7370,9,1 Samuel,7,17,And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.
7371,9,1 Samuel,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel."
7372,9,1 Samuel,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba."
7373,9,1 Samuel,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment."
7374,9,1 Samuel,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,"
7375,9,1 Samuel,8,5,"And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
7376,9,1 Samuel,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD."
7377,9,1 Samuel,8,7,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them."
7378,9,1 Samuel,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee."
7379,9,1 Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them."
7380,9,1 Samuel,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
7381,9,1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots."
7382,9,1 Samuel,8,12,"And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots."
7383,9,1 Samuel,8,13,"And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers."
7384,9,1 Samuel,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants."
7385,9,1 Samuel,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
7386,9,1 Samuel,8,16,"And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work."
7387,9,1 Samuel,8,17,He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
7388,9,1 Samuel,8,18,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
7389,9,1 Samuel,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;"
7390,9,1 Samuel,8,20,"That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
7391,9,1 Samuel,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD."
7392,9,1 Samuel,8,22,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city."
7393,9,1 Samuel,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power."
7394,9,1 Samuel,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people."
7395,9,1 Samuel,9,3,"And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses."
7396,9,1 Samuel,9,4,"And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not."
7397,9,1 Samuel,9,5,"And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us."
7398,9,1 Samuel,9,6,"And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go."
7399,9,1 Samuel,9,7,"Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?"
7400,9,1 Samuel,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way."
7401,9,1 Samuel,9,9,"(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)"
7402,9,1 Samuel,9,10,"Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was."
7403,9,1 Samuel,9,11,"And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?"
7404,9,1 Samuel,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:"
7405,9,1 Samuel,9,13,"As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him."
7406,9,1 Samuel,9,14,"And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place."
7407,9,1 Samuel,9,15,"Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,"
7408,9,1 Samuel,9,16,"To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me."
7409,9,1 Samuel,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people."
7410,9,1 Samuel,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is."
7411,9,1 Samuel,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart."
7412,9,1 Samuel,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?"
7413,9,1 Samuel,9,21,"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?"
7414,9,1 Samuel,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons."
7415,9,1 Samuel,9,23,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee."
7416,9,1 Samuel,9,24,"And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."
7417,9,1 Samuel,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house."
7418,9,1 Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad."
7419,9,1 Samuel,9,27,"And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God."
7420,9,1 Samuel,10,1,"Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?"
7421,9,1 Samuel,10,2,"When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
7422,9,1 Samuel,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:"
7423,9,1 Samuel,10,4,"And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands."
7424,9,1 Samuel,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:"
7425,9,1 Samuel,10,6,"And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man."
7426,9,1 Samuel,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee."
7427,9,1 Samuel,10,8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do."
7428,9,1 Samuel,10,9,"And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day."
7429,9,1 Samuel,10,10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
7430,9,1 Samuel,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
7431,9,1 Samuel,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
7432,9,1 Samuel,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
7433,9,1 Samuel,10,14,"And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel."
7434,9,1 Samuel,10,15,"And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you."
7435,9,1 Samuel,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not."
7436,9,1 Samuel,10,17,And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
7437,9,1 Samuel,10,18,"And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:"
7438,9,1 Samuel,10,19,"And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands."
7439,9,1 Samuel,10,20,"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
7440,9,1 Samuel,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found."
7441,9,1 Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff."
7442,9,1 Samuel,10,23,"And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward."
7443,9,1 Samuel,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king."
7444,9,1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house."
7445,9,1 Samuel,10,26,"And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched."
7446,9,1 Samuel,10,27,"But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace."
7447,9,1 Samuel,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee."
7448,9,1 Samuel,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel."
7449,9,1 Samuel,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee."
7450,9,1 Samuel,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept."
7451,9,1 Samuel,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh."
7452,9,1 Samuel,11,6,"And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly."
7453,9,1 Samuel,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent."
7454,9,1 Samuel,11,8,"And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
7455,9,1 Samuel,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad."
7456,9,1 Samuel,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you."
7457,9,1 Samuel,11,11,"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together."
7458,9,1 Samuel,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death."
7459,9,1 Samuel,11,13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel."
7460,9,1 Samuel,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
7461,9,1 Samuel,11,15,And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
7462,9,1 Samuel,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you."
7463,9,1 Samuel,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day."
7464,9,1 Samuel,12,3,"Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you."
7465,9,1 Samuel,12,4,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand."
7466,9,1 Samuel,12,5,"And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness."
7467,9,1 Samuel,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt."
7468,9,1 Samuel,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers."
7469,9,1 Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place."
7470,9,1 Samuel,12,9,"And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them."
7471,9,1 Samuel,12,10,"And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee."
7472,9,1 Samuel,12,11,"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe."
7473,9,1 Samuel,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king."
7474,9,1 Samuel,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you."
7475,9,1 Samuel,12,14,"If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:"
7476,9,1 Samuel,12,15,"But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers."
7477,9,1 Samuel,12,16,"Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes."
7478,9,1 Samuel,12,17,"Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king."
7479,9,1 Samuel,12,18,So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
7480,9,1 Samuel,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king."
7481,9,1 Samuel,12,20,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;"
7482,9,1 Samuel,12,21,"And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain."
7483,9,1 Samuel,12,22,For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
7484,9,1 Samuel,12,23,"Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:"
7485,9,1 Samuel,12,24,"Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you."
7486,9,1 Samuel,12,25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king."
7487,9,1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"
7488,9,1 Samuel,13,2,"Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent."
7489,9,1 Samuel,13,3,"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear."
7490,9,1 Samuel,13,4,"And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal."
7491,9,1 Samuel,13,5,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven."
7492,9,1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits."
7493,9,1 Samuel,13,7,"And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
7494,9,1 Samuel,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him."
7495,9,1 Samuel,13,9,"And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering."
7496,9,1 Samuel,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him."
7497,9,1 Samuel,13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;"
7498,9,1 Samuel,13,12,"Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering."
7499,9,1 Samuel,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever."
7500,9,1 Samuel,13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee."
7501,9,1 Samuel,13,15,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men."
7502,9,1 Samuel,13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash."
7503,9,1 Samuel,13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:"
7504,9,1 Samuel,13,18,And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
7505,9,1 Samuel,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:"
7506,9,1 Samuel,13,20,"But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock."
7507,9,1 Samuel,13,21,"Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads."
7508,9,1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found."
7509,9,1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
7510,9,1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father."
7511,9,1 Samuel,14,2,And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
7512,9,1 Samuel,14,3,"And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone."
7513,9,1 Samuel,14,4,"And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
7514,9,1 Samuel,14,5,"The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah."
7515,9,1 Samuel,14,6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few."
7516,9,1 Samuel,14,7,"And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart."
7517,9,1 Samuel,14,8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them."
7518,9,1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them."
7519,9,1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us."
7520,9,1 Samuel,14,11,"And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."
7521,9,1 Samuel,14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel."
7522,9,1 Samuel,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him."
7523,9,1 Samuel,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow."
7524,9,1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling."
7525,9,1 Samuel,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another."
7526,9,1 Samuel,14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there."
7527,9,1 Samuel,14,18,"And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel."
7528,9,1 Samuel,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand."
7529,9,1 Samuel,14,20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture."
7530,9,1 Samuel,14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan."
7531,9,1 Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle."
7532,9,1 Samuel,14,23,So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.
7533,9,1 Samuel,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food."
7534,9,1 Samuel,14,25,And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
7535,9,1 Samuel,14,26,"And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath."
7536,9,1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened."
7537,9,1 Samuel,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint."
7538,9,1 Samuel,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
7539,9,1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?"
7540,9,1 Samuel,14,31,And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
7541,9,1 Samuel,14,32,"And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood."
7542,9,1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day."
7543,9,1 Samuel,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there."
7544,9,1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
7545,9,1 Samuel,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God."
7546,9,1 Samuel,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day."
7547,9,1 Samuel,14,38,"And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day."
7548,9,1 Samuel,14,39,"For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him."
7549,9,1 Samuel,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee."
7550,9,1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped."
7551,9,1 Samuel,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
7552,9,1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die."
7553,9,1 Samuel,14,44,"And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan."
7554,9,1 Samuel,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not."
7555,9,1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
7556,9,1 Samuel,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them."
7557,9,1 Samuel,14,48,"And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them."
7558,9,1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:"
7559,9,1 Samuel,14,50,"And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle."
7560,9,1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
7561,9,1 Samuel,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
7562,9,1 Samuel,15,1,"Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD."
7563,9,1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt."
7564,9,1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass."
7565,9,1 Samuel,15,4,"And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
7566,9,1 Samuel,15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
7567,9,1 Samuel,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
7568,9,1 Samuel,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt."
7569,9,1 Samuel,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
7570,9,1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly."
7571,9,1 Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,"
7572,9,1 Samuel,15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night."
7573,9,1 Samuel,15,12,"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal."
7574,9,1 Samuel,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD."
7575,9,1 Samuel,15,14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
7576,9,1 Samuel,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
7577,9,1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."
7578,9,1 Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?"
7579,9,1 Samuel,15,18,"And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed."
7580,9,1 Samuel,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?"
7581,9,1 Samuel,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."
7582,9,1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal."
7583,9,1 Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
7584,9,1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king."
7585,9,1 Samuel,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."
7586,9,1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD."
7587,9,1 Samuel,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel."
7588,9,1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent."
7589,9,1 Samuel,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou."
7590,9,1 Samuel,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent."
7591,9,1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God."
7592,9,1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
7593,9,1 Samuel,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
7594,9,1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
7595,9,1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
7596,9,1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
7597,9,1 Samuel,16,1,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons."
7598,9,1 Samuel,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD."
7599,9,1 Samuel,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee."
7600,9,1 Samuel,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?"
7601,9,1 Samuel,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
7602,9,1 Samuel,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him."
7603,9,1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart."
7604,9,1 Samuel,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this."
7605,9,1 Samuel,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this."
7606,9,1 Samuel,16,10,"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these."
7607,9,1 Samuel,16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither."
7608,9,1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he."
7609,9,1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah."
7610,9,1 Samuel,16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."
7611,9,1 Samuel,16,15,"And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee."
7612,9,1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well."
7613,9,1 Samuel,16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me."
7614,9,1 Samuel,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him."
7615,9,1 Samuel,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep."
7616,9,1 Samuel,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul."
7617,9,1 Samuel,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer."
7618,9,1 Samuel,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight."
7619,9,1 Samuel,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
7620,9,1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim."
7621,9,1 Samuel,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines."
7622,9,1 Samuel,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them."
7623,9,1 Samuel,17,4,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
7624,9,1 Samuel,17,5,"And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass."
7625,9,1 Samuel,17,6,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders."
7626,9,1 Samuel,17,7,And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
7627,9,1 Samuel,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me."
7628,9,1 Samuel,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us."
7629,9,1 Samuel,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
7630,9,1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
7631,9,1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul."
7632,9,1 Samuel,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
7633,9,1 Samuel,17,14,And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
7634,9,1 Samuel,17,15,But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
7635,9,1 Samuel,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
7636,9,1 Samuel,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy brethren;"
7637,9,1 Samuel,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge."
7638,9,1 Samuel,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
7639,9,1 Samuel,17,20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle."
7640,9,1 Samuel,17,21,"For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army."
7641,9,1 Samuel,17,22,"And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren."
7642,9,1 Samuel,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them."
7643,9,1 Samuel,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid."
7644,9,1 Samuel,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."
7645,9,1 Samuel,17,26,"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
7646,9,1 Samuel,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
7647,9,1 Samuel,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle."
7648,9,1 Samuel,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?"
7649,9,1 Samuel,17,30,"And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
7650,9,1 Samuel,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him."
7651,9,1 Samuel,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
7652,9,1 Samuel,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
7653,9,1 Samuel,17,34,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"
7654,9,1 Samuel,17,35,"And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him."
7655,9,1 Samuel,17,36,"Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God."
7656,9,1 Samuel,17,37,"David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee."
7657,9,1 Samuel,17,38,"And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail."
7658,9,1 Samuel,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him."
7659,9,1 Samuel,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."
7660,9,1 Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
7661,9,1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance."
7662,9,1 Samuel,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
7663,9,1 Samuel,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."
7664,9,1 Samuel,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied."
7665,9,1 Samuel,17,46,"This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel."
7666,9,1 Samuel,17,47,"And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands."
7667,9,1 Samuel,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
7668,9,1 Samuel,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth."
7669,9,1 Samuel,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David."
7670,9,1 Samuel,17,51,"Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled."
7671,9,1 Samuel,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron."
7672,9,1 Samuel,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents."
7673,9,1 Samuel,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent."
7674,9,1 Samuel,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell."
7675,9,1 Samuel,17,56,"And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is."
7676,9,1 Samuel,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
7677,9,1 Samuel,17,58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
7678,9,1 Samuel,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
7679,9,1 Samuel,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house."
7680,9,1 Samuel,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
7681,9,1 Samuel,18,4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle."
7682,9,1 Samuel,18,5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants."
7683,9,1 Samuel,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music."
7684,9,1 Samuel,18,7,"And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
7685,9,1 Samuel,18,8,"And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?"
7686,9,1 Samuel,18,9,And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
7687,9,1 Samuel,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand."
7688,9,1 Samuel,18,11,"And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice."
7689,9,1 Samuel,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul."
7690,9,1 Samuel,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
7691,9,1 Samuel,18,14,And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
7692,9,1 Samuel,18,15,"Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him."
7693,9,1 Samuel,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them."
7694,9,1 Samuel,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him."
7695,9,1 Samuel,18,18,"And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?"
7696,9,1 Samuel,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife."
7697,9,1 Samuel,18,20,"And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
7698,9,1 Samuel,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain."
7699,9,1 Samuel,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law."
7700,9,1 Samuel,18,23,"And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
7701,9,1 Samuel,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David."
7702,9,1 Samuel,18,25,"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
7703,9,1 Samuel,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired."
7704,9,1 Samuel,18,27,"Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife."
7705,9,1 Samuel,18,28,"And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him."
7706,9,1 Samuel,18,29,And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
7707,9,1 Samuel,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by."
7708,9,1 Samuel,19,1,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David."
7709,9,1 Samuel,19,2,"But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:"
7710,9,1 Samuel,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee."
7711,9,1 Samuel,19,4,"And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:"
7712,9,1 Samuel,19,5,"For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?"
7713,9,1 Samuel,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain."
7714,9,1 Samuel,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past."
7715,9,1 Samuel,19,8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him."
7716,9,1 Samuel,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand."
7717,9,1 Samuel,19,10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night."
7718,9,1 Samuel,19,11,"Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain."
7719,9,1 Samuel,19,12,"So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped."
7720,9,1 Samuel,19,13,"And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth."
7721,9,1 Samuel,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick."
7722,9,1 Samuel,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him."
7723,9,1 Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster."
7724,9,1 Samuel,19,17,"And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?"
7725,9,1 Samuel,19,18,"So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth."
7726,9,1 Samuel,19,19,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
7727,9,1 Samuel,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."
7728,9,1 Samuel,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also."
7729,9,1 Samuel,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah."
7730,9,1 Samuel,19,23,"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
7731,9,1 Samuel,19,24,"And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
7732,9,1 Samuel,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?"
7733,9,1 Samuel,20,2,"And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so."
7734,9,1 Samuel,20,3,"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death."
7735,9,1 Samuel,20,4,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee."
7736,9,1 Samuel,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even."
7737,9,1 Samuel,20,6,"If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family."
7738,9,1 Samuel,20,7,"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him."
7739,9,1 Samuel,20,8,"Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?"
7740,9,1 Samuel,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?"
7741,9,1 Samuel,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?"
7742,9,1 Samuel,20,11,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."
7743,9,1 Samuel,20,12,"And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and show it thee;"
7744,9,1 Samuel,20,13,"The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will show it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father."
7745,9,1 Samuel,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:"
7746,9,1 Samuel,20,15,"But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth."
7747,9,1 Samuel,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies."
7748,9,1 Samuel,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
7749,9,1 Samuel,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty."
7750,9,1 Samuel,20,19,"And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel."
7751,9,1 Samuel,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark."
7752,9,1 Samuel,20,21,"And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth."
7753,9,1 Samuel,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away."
7754,9,1 Samuel,20,23,"And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever."
7755,9,1 Samuel,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat."
7756,9,1 Samuel,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty."
7757,9,1 Samuel,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean."
7758,9,1 Samuel,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?"
7759,9,1 Samuel,20,28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:"
7760,9,1 Samuel,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table."
7761,9,1 Samuel,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?"
7762,9,1 Samuel,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."
7763,9,1 Samuel,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?"
7764,9,1 Samuel,20,33,And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
7765,9,1 Samuel,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."
7766,9,1 Samuel,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him."
7767,9,1 Samuel,20,36,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
7768,9,1 Samuel,20,37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?"
7769,9,1 Samuel,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
7770,9,1 Samuel,20,39,But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
7771,9,1 Samuel,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city."
7772,9,1 Samuel,20,41,"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded."
7773,9,1 Samuel,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city."
7774,9,1 Samuel,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?"
7775,9,1 Samuel,21,2,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place."
7776,9,1 Samuel,21,3,"Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present."
7777,9,1 Samuel,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women."
7778,9,1 Samuel,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."
7779,9,1 Samuel,21,6,"So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away."
7780,9,1 Samuel,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul."
7781,9,1 Samuel,21,8,"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
7782,9,1 Samuel,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me."
7783,9,1 Samuel,21,10,"And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
7784,9,1 Samuel,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
7785,9,1 Samuel,21,12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
7786,9,1 Samuel,21,13,"And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."
7787,9,1 Samuel,21,14,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?"
7788,9,1 Samuel,21,15,"Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?"
7789,9,1 Samuel,22,1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him."
7790,9,1 Samuel,22,2,"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."
7791,9,1 Samuel,22,3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me."
7792,9,1 Samuel,22,4,And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
7793,9,1 Samuel,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth."
7794,9,1 Samuel,22,6,"When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)"
7795,9,1 Samuel,22,7,"Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;"
7796,9,1 Samuel,22,8,"That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
7797,9,1 Samuel,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
7798,9,1 Samuel,22,10,"And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
7799,9,1 Samuel,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king."
7800,9,1 Samuel,22,12,"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord."
7801,9,1 Samuel,22,13,"And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
7802,9,1 Samuel,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thine house?"
7803,9,1 Samuel,22,15,"Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more."
7804,9,1 Samuel,22,16,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house."
7805,9,1 Samuel,22,17,"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD."
7806,9,1 Samuel,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod."
7807,9,1 Samuel,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
7808,9,1 Samuel,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."
7809,9,1 Samuel,22,21,And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.
7810,9,1 Samuel,22,22,"And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house."
7811,9,1 Samuel,22,23,"Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard."
7812,9,1 Samuel,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors."
7813,9,1 Samuel,23,2,"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah."
7814,9,1 Samuel,23,3,"And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
7815,9,1 Samuel,23,4,"Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand."
7816,9,1 Samuel,23,5,"So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah."
7817,9,1 Samuel,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand."
7818,9,1 Samuel,23,7,"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars."
7819,9,1 Samuel,23,8,"And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men."
7820,9,1 Samuel,23,9,"And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod."
7821,9,1 Samuel,23,10,"Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake."
7822,9,1 Samuel,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down."
7823,9,1 Samuel,23,12,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up."
7824,9,1 Samuel,23,13,"Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth."
7825,9,1 Samuel,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand."
7826,9,1 Samuel,23,15,And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
7827,9,1 Samuel,23,16,"And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God."
7828,9,1 Samuel,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth."
7829,9,1 Samuel,23,18,"And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house."
7830,9,1 Samuel,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?"
7831,9,1 Samuel,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand."
7832,9,1 Samuel,23,21,"And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me."
7833,9,1 Samuel,23,22,"Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly."
7834,9,1 Samuel,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah."
7835,9,1 Samuel,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon."
7836,9,1 Samuel,23,25,"Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon."
7837,9,1 Samuel,23,26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them."
7838,9,1 Samuel,23,27,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land."
7839,9,1 Samuel,23,28,"Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth."
7840,9,1 Samuel,23,29,"And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi."
7841,9,1 Samuel,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi."
7842,9,1 Samuel,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats."
7843,9,1 Samuel,24,3,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave."
7844,9,1 Samuel,24,4,"And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily."
7845,9,1 Samuel,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt."
7846,9,1 Samuel,24,6,"And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD."
7847,9,1 Samuel,24,7,"So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way."
7848,9,1 Samuel,24,8,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself."
7849,9,1 Samuel,24,9,"And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?"
7850,9,1 Samuel,24,10,"Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed."
7851,9,1 Samuel,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it."
7852,9,1 Samuel,24,12,"The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee."
7853,9,1 Samuel,24,13,"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee."
7854,9,1 Samuel,24,14,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."
7855,9,1 Samuel,24,15,"The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand."
7856,9,1 Samuel,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept."
7857,9,1 Samuel,24,17,"And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil."
7858,9,1 Samuel,24,18,"And thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not."
7859,9,1 Samuel,24,19,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day."
7860,9,1 Samuel,24,20,"And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand."
7861,9,1 Samuel,24,21,"Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house."
7862,9,1 Samuel,24,22,And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
7863,9,1 Samuel,25,1,"And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
7864,9,1 Samuel,25,2,"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
7865,9,1 Samuel,25,3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb."
7866,9,1 Samuel,25,4,And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
7867,9,1 Samuel,25,5,"And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:"
7868,9,1 Samuel,25,6,"And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast."
7869,9,1 Samuel,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel."
7870,9,1 Samuel,25,8,"Ask thy young men, and they will show thee. Wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David."
7871,9,1 Samuel,25,9,"And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased."
7872,9,1 Samuel,25,10,"And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master."
7873,9,1 Samuel,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?"
7874,9,1 Samuel,25,12,"So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings."
7875,9,1 Samuel,25,13,"And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff."
7876,9,1 Samuel,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them."
7877,9,1 Samuel,25,15,"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:"
7878,9,1 Samuel,25,16,"They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
7879,9,1 Samuel,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him."
7880,9,1 Samuel,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses."
7881,9,1 Samuel,25,19,"And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal."
7882,9,1 Samuel,25,20,"And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them."
7883,9,1 Samuel,25,21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good."
7884,9,1 Samuel,25,22,"So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall."
7885,9,1 Samuel,25,23,"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"
7886,9,1 Samuel,25,24,"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid."
7887,9,1 Samuel,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send."
7888,9,1 Samuel,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal."
7889,9,1 Samuel,25,27,"And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord."
7890,9,1 Samuel,25,28,"I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days."
7891,9,1 Samuel,25,29,"Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling."
7892,9,1 Samuel,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;"
7893,9,1 Samuel,25,31,"That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offense of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid."
7894,9,1 Samuel,25,32,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:"
7895,9,1 Samuel,25,33,"And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand."
7896,9,1 Samuel,25,34,"For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall."
7897,9,1 Samuel,25,35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person."
7898,9,1 Samuel,25,36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light."
7899,9,1 Samuel,25,37,"But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone."
7900,9,1 Samuel,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died."
7901,9,1 Samuel,25,39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife."
7902,9,1 Samuel,25,40,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife."
7903,9,1 Samuel,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
7904,9,1 Samuel,25,42,"And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
7905,9,1 Samuel,25,43,David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
7906,9,1 Samuel,25,44,"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim."
7907,9,1 Samuel,26,1,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?"
7908,9,1 Samuel,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
7909,9,1 Samuel,26,3,"And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness."
7910,9,1 Samuel,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed."
7911,9,1 Samuel,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him."
7912,9,1 Samuel,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee."
7913,9,1 Samuel,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him."
7914,9,1 Samuel,26,8,"Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time."
7915,9,1 Samuel,26,9,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?"
7916,9,1 Samuel,26,10,"David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish."
7917,9,1 Samuel,26,11,"The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go."
7918,9,1 Samuel,26,12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them."
7919,9,1 Samuel,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:"
7920,9,1 Samuel,26,14,"And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?"
7921,9,1 Samuel,26,15,"And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord."
7922,9,1 Samuel,26,16,"This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster."
7923,9,1 Samuel,26,17,"And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king."
7924,9,1 Samuel,26,18,"And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?"
7925,9,1 Samuel,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods."
7926,9,1 Samuel,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains."
7927,9,1 Samuel,26,21,"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
7928,9,1 Samuel,26,22,"And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it."
7929,9,1 Samuel,26,23,"The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed."
7930,9,1 Samuel,26,24,"And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation."
7931,9,1 Samuel,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place."
7932,9,1 Samuel,27,1,"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand."
7933,9,1 Samuel,27,2,"And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
7934,9,1 Samuel,27,3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife."
7935,9,1 Samuel,27,4,And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
7936,9,1 Samuel,27,5,"And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?"
7937,9,1 Samuel,27,6,Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
7938,9,1 Samuel,27,7,And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
7939,9,1 Samuel,27,8,"And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt."
7940,9,1 Samuel,27,9,"And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish."
7941,9,1 Samuel,27,10,"And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites."
7942,9,1 Samuel,27,11,"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines."
7943,9,1 Samuel,27,12,"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever."
7944,9,1 Samuel,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men."
7945,9,1 Samuel,28,2,"And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever."
7946,9,1 Samuel,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land."
7947,9,1 Samuel,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa."
7948,9,1 Samuel,28,5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled."
7949,9,1 Samuel,28,6,"And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets."
7950,9,1 Samuel,28,7,"Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor."
7951,9,1 Samuel,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee."
7952,9,1 Samuel,28,9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
7953,9,1 Samuel,28,10,"And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing."
7954,9,1 Samuel,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel."
7955,9,1 Samuel,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul."
7956,9,1 Samuel,28,13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth."
7957,9,1 Samuel,28,14,"And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself."
7958,9,1 Samuel,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do."
7959,9,1 Samuel,28,16,"Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?"
7960,9,1 Samuel,28,17,"And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David:"
7961,9,1 Samuel,28,18,"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day."
7962,9,1 Samuel,28,19,Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
7963,9,1 Samuel,28,20,"Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night."
7964,9,1 Samuel,28,21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me."
7965,9,1 Samuel,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way."
7966,9,1 Samuel,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed."
7967,9,1 Samuel,28,24,"And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:"
7968,9,1 Samuel,28,25,"And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night."
7969,9,1 Samuel,29,1,Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
7970,9,1 Samuel,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish."
7971,9,1 Samuel,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?"
7972,9,1 Samuel,29,4,"And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?"
7973,9,1 Samuel,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
7974,9,1 Samuel,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not."
7975,9,1 Samuel,29,7,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines."
7976,9,1 Samuel,29,8,"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
7977,9,1 Samuel,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle."
7978,9,1 Samuel,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
7979,9,1 Samuel,29,11,"So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
7980,9,1 Samuel,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;"
7981,9,1 Samuel,30,2,"And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way."
7982,9,1 Samuel,30,3,"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives."
7983,9,1 Samuel,30,4,"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep."
7984,9,1 Samuel,30,5,"And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
7985,9,1 Samuel,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God."
7986,9,1 Samuel,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David."
7987,9,1 Samuel,30,8,"And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all."
7988,9,1 Samuel,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed."
7989,9,1 Samuel,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor."
7990,9,1 Samuel,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;"
7991,9,1 Samuel,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights."
7992,9,1 Samuel,30,13,"And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick."
7993,9,1 Samuel,30,14,"We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."
7994,9,1 Samuel,30,15,"And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company."
7995,9,1 Samuel,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah."
7996,9,1 Samuel,30,17,"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled."
7997,9,1 Samuel,30,18,And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
7998,9,1 Samuel,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all."
7999,9,1 Samuel,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil."
8000,9,1 Samuel,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them."
8001,9,1 Samuel,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart."
8002,9,1 Samuel,30,23,"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand."
8003,9,1 Samuel,30,24,"For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike."
8004,9,1 Samuel,30,25,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day."
8005,9,1 Samuel,30,26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;"
8006,9,1 Samuel,30,27,"To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,"
8007,9,1 Samuel,30,28,"And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,"
8008,9,1 Samuel,30,29,"And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,"
8009,9,1 Samuel,30,30,"And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,"
8010,9,1 Samuel,30,31,"And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt."
8011,9,1 Samuel,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
8012,9,1 Samuel,31,2,"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons."
8013,9,1 Samuel,31,3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers."
8014,9,1 Samuel,31,4,"Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."
8015,9,1 Samuel,31,5,"And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him."
8016,9,1 Samuel,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together."
8017,9,1 Samuel,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
8018,9,1 Samuel,31,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
8019,9,1 Samuel,31,9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people."
8020,9,1 Samuel,31,10,And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.
8021,9,1 Samuel,31,11,And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
8022,9,1 Samuel,31,12,"All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there."
8023,9,1 Samuel,31,13,"And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
13941,19,Psalms,1,1,"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."
13942,19,Psalms,1,2,But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
13943,19,Psalms,1,3,"And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
13944,19,Psalms,1,4,The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
13945,19,Psalms,1,5,"Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous."
13946,19,Psalms,1,6,For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
13947,19,Psalms,2,1,"Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?"
13948,19,Psalms,2,2,"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,"

15090,19,Psalms,76,8,"Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,"
15091,19,Psalms,76,9,"When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah."
15092,19,Psalms,76,10,Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
15093,19,Psalms,76,11,"Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared."
15094,19,Psalms,76,12,He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
15095,19,Psalms,77,1,"I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me."
15096,19,Psalms,77,2,"In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted."
15097,19,Psalms,77,3,"I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah."
15098,19,Psalms,77,4,Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
15099,19,Psalms,77,5,"I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times."
15100,19,Psalms,77,6,I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
15101,19,Psalms,77,7,Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
15102,19,Psalms,77,8,Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
15103,19,Psalms,77,9,Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
15104,19,Psalms,77,10,"And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High."
15105,19,Psalms,77,11,I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
15106,19,Psalms,77,12,"I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings."
15107,19,Psalms,77,13,"Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?"

15110,19,Psalms,77,16,"The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled."
15111,19,Psalms,77,17,The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
15112,19,Psalms,77,18,The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
15113,19,Psalms,77,19,"Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known."
15114,19,Psalms,77,20,Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
15115,19,Psalms,78,1,"Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth."
15116,19,Psalms,78,2,I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
15117,19,Psalms,78,3,"Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us."
15118,19,Psalms,78,4,"We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done."
15119,19,Psalms,78,5,"For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:"
15120,19,Psalms,78,6,"That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:"
15121,19,Psalms,78,7,"That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:"
15122,19,Psalms,78,8,"And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God."
15123,19,Psalms,78,9,"The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle."
15124,19,Psalms,78,10,"They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;"
15125,19,Psalms,78,11,"And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them."
15126,19,Psalms,78,12,"Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan."
15127,19,Psalms,78,13,"He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap."
15128,19,Psalms,78,14,"In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire."
15129,19,Psalms,78,15,"He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths."
15130,19,Psalms,78,16,"He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers."
15131,19,Psalms,78,17,And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
15132,19,Psalms,78,18,And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
15133,19,Psalms,78,19,"Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?"
15134,19,Psalms,78,20,"Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?"
15135,19,Psalms,78,21,"Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;"
15136,19,Psalms,78,22,"Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:"
15137,19,Psalms,78,23,"Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,"
15138,19,Psalms,78,24,"And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven."
15139,19,Psalms,78,25,Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
15140,19,Psalms,78,26,He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
15141,19,Psalms,78,27,"He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:"
15142,19,Psalms,78,28,"And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations."
15143,19,Psalms,78,29,"So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;"
15144,19,Psalms,78,30,"They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,"
15145,19,Psalms,78,31,"The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel."
15146,19,Psalms,78,32,"For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works."
15147,19,Psalms,78,33,"Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble."
15148,19,Psalms,78,34,"When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God."
15149,19,Psalms,78,35,"And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer."
15150,19,Psalms,78,36,"Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues."
15151,19,Psalms,78,37,"For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant."
15152,19,Psalms,78,38,"But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath."
15153,19,Psalms,78,39,"For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again."
15154,19,Psalms,78,40,"How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!"
15155,19,Psalms,78,41,"Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel."
15156,19,Psalms,78,42,"They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy."
15157,19,Psalms,78,43,"How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan."
15158,19,Psalms,78,44,"And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink."
15159,19,Psalms,78,45,"He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them."
15160,19,Psalms,78,46,"He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust."
15161,19,Psalms,78,47,"He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost."
15162,19,Psalms,78,48,"He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts."
15163,19,Psalms,78,49,"He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them."
15164,19,Psalms,78,50,"He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;"
15165,19,Psalms,78,51,And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
15166,19,Psalms,78,52,"But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock."
15167,19,Psalms,78,53,"And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies."
15168,19,Psalms,78,54,"And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased."
15169,19,Psalms,78,55,"He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents."
15170,19,Psalms,78,56,"Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:"
15171,19,Psalms,78,57,"But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow."
15172,19,Psalms,78,58,"For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images."
15173,19,Psalms,78,59,"When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:"
15174,19,Psalms,78,60,"So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;"
15175,19,Psalms,78,61,"And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand."
15176,19,Psalms,78,62,He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
15177,19,Psalms,78,63,The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
15178,19,Psalms,78,64,Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
15179,19,Psalms,78,65,"Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine."
15180,19,Psalms,78,66,And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
15181,19,Psalms,78,67,"Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:"
15182,19,Psalms,78,68,"But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved."
15183,19,Psalms,78,69,"And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever."
15184,19,Psalms,78,70,"He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:"
15185,19,Psalms,78,71,"From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance."
15186,19,Psalms,78,72,So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
15187,19,Psalms,79,1,"O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps."
15188,19,Psalms,79,2,"The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth."
15189,19,Psalms,79,3,Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
15190,19,Psalms,79,4,"We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us."
15191,19,Psalms,79,5,"How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?"
15192,19,Psalms,79,6,"Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name."
15193,19,Psalms,79,7,"For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place."
15194,19,Psalms,79,8,O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
15195,19,Psalms,79,9,"Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake."
15196,19,Psalms,79,10,"Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed."
15197,19,Psalms,79,11,Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
15198,19,Psalms,79,12,"And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord."
15199,19,Psalms,79,13,So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
15200,19,Psalms,80,1,"Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth."
15201,19,Psalms,80,2,"Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us."
15202,19,Psalms,80,3,"Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved."
15203,19,Psalms,80,4,"O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?"
15204,19,Psalms,80,5,Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
15205,19,Psalms,80,6,Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
15206,19,Psalms,80,7,"Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved."
15207,19,Psalms,80,8,"Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it."
15208,19,Psalms,80,9,"Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land."
15209,19,Psalms,80,10,"The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars."
15210,19,Psalms,80,11,"She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river."
15211,19,Psalms,80,12,"Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?"
15212,19,Psalms,80,13,"The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it."
15213,19,Psalms,80,14,"Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;"
15214,19,Psalms,80,15,"And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself."
15215,19,Psalms,80,16,"It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance."
15216,19,Psalms,80,17,"Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself."
15217,19,Psalms,80,18,"So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name."
15218,19,Psalms,80,19,"Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved."
15219,19,Psalms,81,1,Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
15220,19,Psalms,81,2,"Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery."
15221,19,Psalms,81,3,"Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day."
15222,19,Psalms,81,4,"For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob."
15223,19,Psalms,81,5,"This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not."
15224,19,Psalms,81,6,I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
15225,19,Psalms,81,7,"Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah."
15226,19,Psalms,81,8,"Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;"
15227,19,Psalms,81,9,There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
15228,19,Psalms,81,10,"I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it."
15229,19,Psalms,81,11,But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
15230,19,Psalms,81,12,So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
15231,19,Psalms,81,13,"Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!"
15232,19,Psalms,81,14,"I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries."
15233,19,Psalms,81,15,The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
15234,19,Psalms,81,16,He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
15235,19,Psalms,82,1,God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
15236,19,Psalms,82,2,"How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah."
15237,19,Psalms,82,3,Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
15238,19,Psalms,82,4,Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
15239,19,Psalms,82,5,"They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course."
15240,19,Psalms,82,6,"I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High."

15244,19,Psalms,83,2,"For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head."
15245,19,Psalms,83,3,"They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones."
15246,19,Psalms,83,4,"They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance."
15247,19,Psalms,83,5,For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
15248,19,Psalms,83,6,"The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;"
15249,19,Psalms,83,7,"Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;"
15250,19,Psalms,83,8,Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
15251,19,Psalms,83,9,"Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:"
15252,19,Psalms,83,10,Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
15253,19,Psalms,83,11,"Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:"
15254,19,Psalms,83,12,"Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession."
15255,19,Psalms,83,13,"O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind."
15256,19,Psalms,83,14,"As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;"
15257,19,Psalms,83,15,"So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm."
15258,19,Psalms,83,16,"Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD."
15259,19,Psalms,83,17,"Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:"
15260,19,Psalms,83,18,"That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth."
15261,19,Psalms,84,1,"How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!"
15262,19,Psalms,84,2,"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God."
15263,19,Psalms,84,3,"Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God."
15264,19,Psalms,84,4,Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
15265,19,Psalms,84,5,Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.

15269,19,Psalms,84,9,"Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed."
15270,19,Psalms,84,10,"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness."
15271,19,Psalms,84,11,For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
15272,19,Psalms,84,12,"O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee."
15273,19,Psalms,85,1,"Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob."
15274,19,Psalms,85,2,"Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah."
15275,19,Psalms,85,3,Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
15276,19,Psalms,85,4,"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease."
15277,19,Psalms,85,5,Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
15278,19,Psalms,85,6,Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
15279,19,Psalms,85,7,"Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation."
15280,19,Psalms,85,8,"I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly."
15281,19,Psalms,85,9,Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
15282,19,Psalms,85,10,Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
15283,19,Psalms,85,11,Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
15284,19,Psalms,85,12,"Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase."
